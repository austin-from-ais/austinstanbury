HUSH is a virtual reality escape room experience directed and produced by graduate students in the University of Florida MiDAS program. Players find themselves trapped in a haunted mansion, searching for clues and solving puzzles to escape.

I worked on lighting and 3D prop creation for the experience. The game featured interactive puzzle mechanics including a candle lighting sequence and a Ouija board puzzle with controller haptics. We leveraged Unity HDRP to deliver high-fidelity graphics on Oculus Quest 2, with special effects built in VFX Graph.

The 3D asset pipeline involved modeling low-poly geometries in Maya, creating UVs for optimal texturing, texturing in Substance Painter with layered materials, then importing into Unity with proper mesh normals. Props needed to coordinate with programmers and animators to allow for ideal interactions.

This was a student-led class project with an 11-person team, developed September through December 2021 under professors George Heitzman and Seunghyuk Jang. We used Scrum methodology with weekly sprints, a Trello board, and regular team meetings to coordinate across modeling, programming, and design teams.
