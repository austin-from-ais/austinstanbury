HUSH is a virtual reality escape room experience directed and produced by graduate students in the University of Florida MiDAS program. Players find themselves trapped in a haunted mansion, searching for clues and solving puzzles to escape.

I worked on lighting and 3D prop creation for the experience. The game featured interactive puzzle mechanics including a candle lighting sequence and a Ouija board puzzle with controller haptics. We leveraged Unity HDRP to deliver high-fidelity graphics on Oculus Quest 2, with special effects built in VFX Graph.

This was a student-led class project with an 11-person team, developed over the Fall 2021 semester under professors George Heitzman and Seunghyuk Jang. We used Scrum methodology with weekly sprints and a Trello board to coordinate across modeling, programming, and design teams.
