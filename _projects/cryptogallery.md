CryptoGallery is a blockchain-enhanced virtual art gallery that uses the ChainSafe SDK to rapidly display art stored on the blockchain within virtual reality museum exhibits. The gallery supports multiplayer functionality through Normcore, allowing users to connect over the internet and interact via voice chat. The space accommodates 3D virtual installations, 2D art exhibits, and video content including a virtual cinema.

**How It Works**

Artwork stored on the blockchain is pulled into the gallery in real time using the ChainSafe SDK, populating exhibits across the virtual space. Users can visit simultaneously through Normcore's multiplayer framework, walking through the gallery together and communicating via built-in voice chat. The gallery architecture was designed in Revit, providing a structured museum environment for displaying a range of content types.

My role on the project was the VR development, Normcore multiplayer integration, and ChainSafe blockchain integration.

Developed with the MIDAS students at the University of Florida Digital Worlds Institute.
