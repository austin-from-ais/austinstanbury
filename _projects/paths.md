PATHS is an NSF-funded 8-week training program designed to prepare autistic individuals for careers in the semiconductor industry. The program combines online lectures, VR-based hands-on training, in-person cleanroom and lab experiences at the University of Florida, and one-on-one mentorship from industry experts at companies like Micron, AMD, Intel, and GlobalFoundries. Selected participants are eligible for internships with semiconductor and defense technology companies, with stipends up to $10,000 fully covered by UF.

**AIS Role**

Augmented Info Systems collaborated with UF from the program's conception, helping launch the initiative and developing the VR training components that give participants hands-on experience with semiconductor processes in an accessible, immersive environment.

**Program Structure**

The program runs over eight weeks. Week one is an in-person workshop at the University of Florida, where participants get direct exposure to cleanroom and lab environments. Weeks two through seven shift to online lectures with integrated VR training and one-on-one industry mentorship — participants receive VR headsets so they can complete hands-on training modules remotely. Week eight is an online employment bootcamp hosted by industry experts and CARD staff, focused on preparing participants for internship and career opportunities. A completion incentive of up to $500 is provided.

**Eligibility**

PATHS is open to autistic adults in the United States who are pursuing or hold an Associate's or Bachelor's degree in a STEM field.

**Collaboration**

The program is a collaboration between the University of Florida Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering, the Center for Autism and Related Disabilities (CARD) at UF, and industry partners including NHanced, SkyWater, and Lockheed Martin. Augmented Info Systems collaborated with UF from the program's conception.

Built with Augmented Info Systems and the University of Florida.
