Sol is an interactive holographic lesson about the solar system built for the original Microsoft HoloLens. The application guides students through the planets and celestial bodies in our solar system via narrated, interactive lessons presented as holograms in the user's physical space. Users can explore planets at scale, resize them, observe atmospheric effects, and learn about each body through voice-narrated educational content. All eight planets, Pluto, the Sun, and major meteor and asteroid objects are included, displayed with relative sizing.

**Modes**

Sol features two modes of interaction. The guided tour walks students through a linear narrated lesson, moving planet by planet with educational content at each stop. Freeplay opens the full system for exploration—users can freely interact with any celestial body, resize objects with pinch gestures, and examine atmospheric details up close.

**Development**

The project was built entirely solo—all programming, visual effects, shader work, and design were done by a single developer. Voice narration for every lesson was self-recorded. The application runs on the first-generation Microsoft HoloLens using MRTK for hand tracking, gaze tracking, button interaction, and pinch-to-resize gestures. Real-world occlusion grounds the holograms in physical space, and custom flow shaders simulate planetary atmospheres and lighting effects. 3D models were sourced from NASA planetary scans.

Building for the original HoloLens presented unique constraints—limited processing power, a narrow field of view, and early-stage spatial computing tools. Working within those limitations while producing a polished educational experience was a defining challenge of the project.

**Presentation**

Sol was presented at the MA thesis panel defense at the University of Florida Digital Worlds Institute and at Convergence, the MIDAS keystone showcase event, where it received strong audience engagement.
