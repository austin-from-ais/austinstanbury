note: "First French hackathon—we did the entire 8-minute demo video in French even though we were all more comfortable in English. At one point we had 40 minutes to design stickers, print them, push the app to the phone, and run to the store before it closed to film a demo. Also the first time we got Firebase Firestore to actually work in a project."

FreshMatch is an application designed to help businesses and private shoppers connect with local producers. It serves as a "smart broker" that reduces the time necessary for consumers to source local produce, addressing inefficiencies in local food markets.

For restaurants and organizations, the app matches users with local producers based on preferences using a Tinder-style swipe mechanism. For producers, we built AR branding tools—small markers the size of fruit stickers that display producer information when scanned in supermarkets. Private shoppers can use the app to quickly locate local food during their regular shopping trips.

We used Firebase Authentication for user accounts and Firestore for real-time data storage—finally getting it to work after failing to integrate it in previous projects. The AR system was built with Vuforia, and we designed the full UX flow in Adobe XD.
