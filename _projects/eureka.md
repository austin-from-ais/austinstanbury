Eureka! is a prototype technology that utilizes Vuforia Engine to generate AR image markers from book covers. Deployed on mobile devices, it uses onboard cellphone cameras to perform image recognition on books. When a book is recognized, Eureka! generates a graphical overlay presenting information about the book's key concepts, history, and relationship to other texts.

Users navigate through this information by selecting key terms, authors, genres, publishing dates, and more. This presents a novel way for library patrons to interact with and navigate through physical media, combining aspects of traditional library media consumption with modern search-engine and wiki features.
