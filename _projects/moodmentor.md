MoodMentor is a VR application designed to improve mindfulness skills in neurodivergent adults, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), and Acquired Brain Injuries (ABI). The project was developed in collaboration with [Road to Responsibility](https://www.roadtoresponsibility.org/), a Massachusetts nonprofit founded in 1988, alongside South Shore Support Services, WORK, Inc., and the Arc of Bristol County.

The opportunity emerged in late spring 2023, when the Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services (DDS) issued a request for responses seeking innovative approaches to help people with disabilities succeed in employment and community inclusion. The four organizations submitted a combined response focused on using VR to facilitate skill development, and a partnership was formed with the University of Florida's Advanced Technologies Learning Lab to bring it to life.

Clinically, mindfulness has been strongly linked to improved emotional and behavioral regulation and improved decision making. It involves observing details in natural and interpersonal environments, accurately describing what is being observed, and then taking effective action. The clinical team at Road to Responsibility provided information and suggestions, and the technical team in Florida translated them into an immersive VR experience. The first scenario, Mood Mentor, was completed by December 2023.

Persons with ASD tend to struggle reading social cues and generally experience higher levels of stress and anxiety when interacting with others. Traditional clinical approaches like applied behavior analysis (ABA) can be helpful, but the learning process is slow and complicated, and skill acquisition occurs in high-stakes real-life situations. VR offered a way to practice in a safe, controlled environment.

Beta testing began in January 2024. The results were encouraging—members who had difficulty sustaining their attention for more than a minute or two were able to focus on the scenario for up to 10 minutes. The overwhelming majority of participants responded positively to the technology. An unexpected side effect was also observed: members were visibly more relaxed after using the VR than they had been beforehand.

The project was featured in [South Shore Magazine's Spring 2024 issue](https://southshoremagazine.uberflip.com/i/1518307-ssm-spring-2024-issue/23), in an article written by Chris White, Ed.D., President and CEO of Road to Responsibility. Our design research was published at IEEE GEM 2024 at Politecnico di Torino as "MoodMentor: Virtual Reality UI/UX Design Considerations for Neurodivergent Users" with Ines Said.

Built with the University of Florida Advanced Technologies Learning Lab for Road to Responsibility, South Shore Support Services, WORK, Inc., and the Arc of Bristol County.
