note: "Built this right before the 2020 election. As relatively new voters ourselves, we reflected on the challenges we faced during the last few election cycles—not knowing how to vote, what to bring, getting turned away after standing in line for hours. Add COVID-19 to the mix and it felt like the right problem to tackle."

VoteR is a virtual reality mobile application developed for Google Cardboard that educates users about the voting process. The experience places users in an urban environment waiting in line to vote, then guides them through the full process of casting a ballot during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The application teaches users how to vote by walking them through the process in VR, what they need to bring to the polls, and proper safety practices including social distancing. By the end of the experience, users have been through the full voting process at least once before doing it in person—and earn a completion badge to share.

We used Google Cardboard to ensure accessibility—it's a low-cost VR solution that brings this technology into everyone's hands.

**Winner: Best Use of Google Cloud (COVID-19 Hackathon Fund)**, **Best Hardware Hack (Digi-Key)**, and **Best Use of Google Cloud – 2nd Place** at VandyHacks VII.

Built with Ines Said, Jordan Smith, and Aadithya Gowthaman.
