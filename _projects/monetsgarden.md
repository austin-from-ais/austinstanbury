Monet's Garden is a VR experience offering guided meditation, relaxing virtual walks, and creative light painting in a photorealistic public garden. Enter from the office, school, or home and be instantly transported to a lush garden with broad walking paths, a bamboo forest, and a pergola for guided meditation.

I developed the landscape design and contributed substantially to the environment and scenery composition. We started with a landscape design plan informed by the University of Florida IFAS extension guide, then modeled basic assets in Maya before building out the scene with Quixel Megascans photogrammetry models.

The environment leverages Unity's HDRP with local volumes for personalized lighting effects, volumetric fog, baked lighting, and post-processing overrides including bloom, vignette, and screen space ambient occlusion. Users can also light paint throughout the gardens using hand-tracked particle systems.

Built with Ines Said, Patrick Molen, and Bingyu Li.
