Developed XR training software in collaboration with the Florida Semiconductor Institute to support semiconductor education under the SCALE initiative. Sub-award via Purdue to University of Florida ($450,000).

This project resulted in four peer-reviewed publications and deployment across university classrooms. The training modules combine mixed reality visualization of microelectronics concepts with AI-driven pedagogical agents that adapt to individual student needs.
