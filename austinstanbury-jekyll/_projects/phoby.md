Phoby is a virtual reality application designed to help users confront and manage common phobias through controlled exposure therapy. The experience places users in gradually intensifying scenarios tailored to specific fears—heights, spiders, public speaking—while maintaining a sense of safety and control.

The project explored how immersive environments could replicate the physiological responses associated with phobias while giving users tools to self-regulate.
