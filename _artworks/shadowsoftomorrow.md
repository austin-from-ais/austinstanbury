Shadows of Tomorrow is an immersive extended reality installation that uses climate narratives to raise awareness about the realities of climate change. The project originated as a semifinalist in the AWE XR Challenge, a competition that drew over 150 projects focused on using XR technology to address climate change.

The work was published at ACM VRST 2023 (29th ACM Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology) in Christchurch, New Zealand as "Immersive Climate Narratives: Using Extended Reality to Raise Climate Change Awareness" with Ines Said, Erica Delhagen, and Dr. Hyo Jeong Kang.

The installation was awarded a $500 prize by the Gainesville Fine Arts Association. The jury included Jane Gilbert, Chief Heat Officer and founder of One Billion Resilient, and Jeff Goodell, author of *The Heat Will Kill You First*. The piece was installed at the UF Hub Gallery Wall as part of an artists reception, and was selected as an Art Grant Recipient for display at MIT Reality Hack 2025.

In April 2025, Ines and I were invited as guest speakers at Parsons School of Design, where we presented Shadows of Tomorrow alongside Covid Reflections. The lecture focused on designing immersive XR installations with AI, covering our approach to human-centered design, the role of AI in creative workflows, and the production process behind both projects.

Built with Ines Said, Erica Delhagen, and Dr. Hyo Jeong Kang.
